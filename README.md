Overall theme of website- I was going for that greyish dark theme layout. Its calm on my eyes and looks very clean. I wanted to keep my site very simple with the colors and keep it consistent. 

I used HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

I accomplished the project by doing sections 1 at a time. Navbar, Hero, About Me, Projects, Footer. I learned a lot during this project, the thing I dreaded the most about in the beginning was overcoming the struggle of responsive design using media queries. It really pushed me, and that concept alone allowed me to understand layout positioning and flexbox even more. I love the growth I have experienced through this project and it motivates me to keep pushing through. 

My approach was mobile first, using chrome devTools a lot. I would put the view mode in mobile mode and create my designs from there, and then change it to desktop and make my edits in the media queries. I followed this pattern back and forth throughout the whole project, I truly had fun. 

I did a lot of research online as well, seeing how code worked for others and gaining an understanding on different CSS concepts that I have unfamiliarity with. 

Steps I Took
1. Write the HTML
2. Styled each section via CSS, one at a time
3. Used JS DOM manipulation wherever the manipulation was warrented such as (Navbar- Hambuger Menu) and (Modals, Buttons)
4. Back and forth in different views using chrome devTools to help make the website responsive
5. Researched different concepts throughout the project to gain a better understanding before I implement it
6. After everything was done, did some final check ups. and everything looks ready to go.
